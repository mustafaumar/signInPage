# React Sign-In Project
#### This is a simple React project that demonstrates how to validate email and password inputs for sign-in functionality. The project has a simple login form where users can input their email and password, and the form will validate the input before submission.
# Prerequisites
#### Before starting, you should have the following software installed on your machine:
- Node.js
- npm 
# Getting Started
#### To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and install the dependencies using the following commands:
- `git clone https://github.com/mustafaumar/signInPage.git` (Using HTTPS)
-  `git clone git@github.com:mustafaumar/signInPage.git` (Using SSH)
- `cd signInPage`
- `npm install` (Install node modules)
# Validation
#### The validation for the email and password inputs is done using array methods. The regular expression for email validation checks if the input has the '@' in the email format. The  password validation checks if the input is at least 6 characters long.
# Running the Application
#### To run the application, use the following command:
- `npm start`
#### This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser. You can now enter an email and password in the login form, and the form will validate the inputs before submission.
